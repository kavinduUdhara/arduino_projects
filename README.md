### robot_car_1
This code is for controlling an Arduino powered car using a servo motor and ultrasonic sensor, which can receive commands through Bluetooth to move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and stop. The Servo.h and Ultrasonic.h libraries are used to control the servo motor and measure the distance to an object in front of the ultrasonic sensor, respectively. The servo motor is connected to pin A0, and the ultrasonic sensor is connected to pins A2 (Trig Pin) and A1 (Echo Pin). The car is powered by two motors, motor A and motor B, which are controlled by the L298N motor driver. The speed of the motors is set to the lowest value (100) in the code. The Bluetooth connection is established at 9600 baud rate. The commands received from Bluetooth are read in the loop function and executed accordingly using various functions like go_forward, go_backward, turn_left, turn_right, and stop. The servo motor position is changed using the servo_motor_forward, servo_motor_right, and servo_motor_left functions.
